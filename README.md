I'm Nahuel, a Full Stack Developer and technology enthusiast from Argentina. I began my professional journey during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. Today, my responsibilities include developing and maintaining server-side logic, ensuring high performance and responsiveness to requests from the front-end, and managing database integration. I also focus on creating efficient APIs, optimizing backend processes, and collaborating with team members to set objectives and design scalable, robust systems.

I thrive on new challenges, leveraging my backend development experience, strong problem-solving skills, and attention to detail to deliver effective solutions.

Feel free to clone my projects, raise issues, and submit PRs if you have suggestions for improvements.
